# Internship Weekly Report - Week 5

**Name:** Sandeep Ravaji Patel
**Domain:** Data Science
**Week Number:** Week 5

## Task Description

**Objective:**

To develop skills in building and evaluating supervised machine learning models, specifically focusing on classification and regression using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression algorithms with Scikit-Learn.

**Tasks Completed:**

* Learned the key differences between regression and classification problems.
* Understood how Logistic Regression is used for binary classification.
* Implemented Decision Tree Classifier for rule-based decision making.
* Used datasets such as tennis.csv to train classification models.
* Applied Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-Learn.
* Split data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.
* Trained models and made predictions on unseen data.
* Measured model performance using:
    * Accuracy Score
    * Confusion Matrix
    * Classification Report
* Interpreted confusion matrices and accuracy scores to assess model quality.

**Tools Used:**

* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook


## Challenges Faced

1.  **Dataset Structure Understanding:**

    * Took time to understand the structure and meaning of features in tennis.csv.
2.  **Classification Evaluation:**

    * Initially unclear on how to interpret confusion matrix outputs.
    * **Resolution:** Reviewed metric documentation and practical examples for better clarity.

## Learning Outcome

* Developed a solid understanding of classification algorithms and their real-world application.
* Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using Scikit-Learn.
* Gained experience with performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
* Improved ability to analyze results and interpret machine learning outputs.

## Next Steps

For Week 6, the focus will be on:

* Learning Unsupervised Learning techniques.
* Implementing K-Means Clustering and performing PCA for dimensionality reduction.
